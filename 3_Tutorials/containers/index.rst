Containers
===========

Containers make it possible to run software in isolated, portable environments â€” ensuring that your applications and their dependencies behave consistently across different systems.

This section introduces **Singularity**, the container platform used on ARCH Systems, and covers key workflows including:

- Building custom Singularity images from scratch or from DockerHub
- Running pre-built containers without administrative privileges
- Using containers to support reproducible research pipelines

Whether you need to package a complex bioinformatics tool or ensure reproducibility across HPC jobs, containers offer a flexible and powerful solution.
