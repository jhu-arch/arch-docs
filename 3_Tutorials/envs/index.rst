Environments & Packages
=======================

ARCH provides flexible tools to create isolated environments for Python, R, and multi-language workflows. By working within a virtual environment, users can install libraries, manage packages, and build reproducible projects without interfering with system-wide software.

This section covers multiple environment types and how to connect them to common platforms:

- **Virtual Environments** — Python venvs, Conda environments, and Spack packages
- **Conda R** — Creating and managing R environments with Conda
- **Link Conda to Jupyter** — Making your Conda environments available as Jupyter kernels
- **Link Conda to RStudio** — Running RStudio Server sessions using a Conda-managed R

Whether you're developing pure Python code, working with machine learning frameworks, managing R packages, or preparing complex HPC workflows, these guides will help you get set up correctly.
