Interactive Interfaces
=======================

ARCH supports a variety of **interactive interfaces** that allow users to work with notebooks, R scripts, web-based applications, and full desktop environments — all running directly on the cluster.

This section provides tutorials for launching and managing the most popular tools:

- **JupyterLab** — Web-based environment for Python, R, and other notebooks
- **Open OnDemand (OOD)** — Web portal offering file management, terminal access, and graphical apps like JupyterLab, RStudio, and VSCode
- **R and RStudio Server** — Browser-based R IDE or command-line R access
- **VS Code Server** — Web-enabled version of Visual Studio Code for HPC workflows

Whether you prefer graphical dashboards or command-line-driven scripts, these guides walk you through setting up secure, efficient interactive sessions tailored to your research and development needs.
