DSAI
========

The Advanced Research Computing at Hopkins (ARCH) manages the High Performance Computing core facility at Johns Hopkins University. DSAI (our current AI system) consists of 80 CPU nodes (8,960 cores), 15 8-way nodes with Nvidia A100 (80GB) gpus, 32 4-way nodes with Nvidia H100 gpus, 8 8-way nodes with Nvidia L40S gpus and 5 PBs of Weka storage. These are “shared resources”, therefore we expect all users to comply with policies on passwords, security guidelines, resource utilization and best practices, and privacy issues

If users have any questions about these policies, please send an email to help@arch.jhu.edu.
