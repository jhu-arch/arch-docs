ARCH Clusters Guide
############################

Welcome!  This site is the one-stop user guide for every high-performance cluster operated by `Advanced Research Computing at Hopkins (ARCH) <https://www.arch.jhu.edu/>`__

The Advanced Research Computing at Hopkins (ARCH) is a shared computing facility at Johns Hopkins University dedicated to supporting research, discovery, and learning through the use and development of advanced computing technologies.

ARCH provides access to high-performance computing (HPC) resources, high-throughput data storage, advanced networking, and scientific support services to empower computational research across all disciplines.

**Mission**

ARCH's mission is to enable research, scholarship, and innovation by offering:

- Access to high-performance computing and storage systems
- Reliable infrastructure for data-intensive computing and simulation
- Scientific consulting for research workflows, application optimization, and data strategy
- Education and training in computational tools and methodologies
- Secure environments for projects involving sensitive data (e.g., HIPAA, IRB)

**Services and Support**

ARCH offers a range of support services to enhance your computational research:

- **Research planning and resource allocation strategy**
- **Traditional HPC simulations** requiring large CPU, memory, and I/O
- **Interactive**Parallel/scalable file systems** for improved data throughput
- **Workflow design** and implementation for computational pipelines
- **Scientific support** for emerging domains such as machine learning and AI
- **Application support** including installation and tuning
- **Short-term project data storage** with file system management
- **Container and virtualization support** (e.g., Singularity)
- **Advanced consulting** in Python, Go, and other research programming languages
- **Fast data transfer** via Globus and JHU's HORNET network
- **Educational and training resources** for students and faculty
- **Colocation facilities** for PI-owned hardware

**History and Governance**

ARCH was previously known as the **Maryland Advanced Research Computing Center (MARCC)**.

- MARCC was a collaborative HPC initiative between **Johns Hopkins University** and the **University of Maryland, College Park**
- Located on JHU’s **Bayview Campus**, with offices at the **Bloomberg Center** on the Homewood Campus
- Funded by the **State of Maryland** through a grant to JHU via the **Institute for Data Intensive Engineering and Science (IDIES)**
